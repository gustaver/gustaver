# Hi, I'm Gustave! 🌊 I am 

* A Computer Science MSc & BSc graduate from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/computer-science/description-1.419974) 🤖
* A Clojure & functional programming enthusiast λ
* A Photographer 📸 Surfer 🏄‍♂️ Snowboarder 🏂 check it out at: [my website](http://www.rousselet.se)

I'm passionate about computer science all around, but some areas I'm currently interested in are: 

* Large scale software engineering
* Data-intensive systems
* Distributed and parallel computing

I haven't had so much time to work on hobby projects during my degree due to working alongside my studies, but I've pinned a couple projects I've worked on that I'm proud of 😄

I've got academic and professional experience in a broad range of areas. [Get in touch](mailto:gustave.rousselet@icloud.com)
